# send-email
Java project for sending emails using 3 methods:
  - Running a program with email details all **hard-coded**
  - Running a program that outputs an **application** for the user to input/change all email details without rerunning the program
  - Running a program that outputs an **applet** for the user to input/change most of the email details (except for the receiving email address and SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server) without rerunning the program.
